# ADR 002: Subscriptions in CosmWasm

## Changelog
* 15-04-2021: Initial Draft
* 19-04-2021: Clarifications on the impact

## Context

The [subscription module](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/tree/f0a7cd77f7a559d147f5c710ce5bf58649d56b1b/x/subscription)
provides a unique functionality of recurrent payments that can be specified using the cronjob notation.
While it is powerful and useful, several concerns have been raised during its development:

1. The code is fairly complex and Go does not give many static analysis guarantees: it is likely the code contains issues
that may hinder performance or could be exploited (e.g. see [this recently identified issue](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/issues/458)).

2. The current implementation is likely non-final: while the payment schedule specification is likely final, 
some peripheral business logic (e.g. [the collection retry mechanism](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/issues/478))
may need changes. If the implementation is put up on the live network, each implementation change will be 
a consensus-breaking change and require synchronization via the gov and upgrade modules.

3. The code requires non-trivial Gas metering explicit specifications: as the current implementation is likely non-final, one will also need to be careful to adjust the Gas meter logic correctly with each change.

Overall, subscriptions are useful, but their current implementation may need to be re-assessed.

## Decision
For the reasons outlined in the context, the subscription module is to be removed from the current repository and its related issues can be closed.
When the CosmWasm module is added (see [ADR-001](./adr-001.md)), the subscription module logic can be re-implemented in Rust
as a CosmWasm smart contract that will be a part of a separate repository dedicated to advanced 
smart contract implementations (crypto-org-chain/cosmwasm-plus-plus).
Before the smart contract is deployed on the live network, its upgrade approach may need to consider the following options for the initial version:

1. Restricting addresses that can instantiate the contract (`instantiate-only-address`), so that the reach is limited to early adopters before the implementation gets more finalized.

2. Setting the admin address in the contract info, so that it can later be upgraded using the `MsgMigrateContract` message.

3. Clearing the admin address and upgrading the contract via the `MigrateContractProposal` governance proposal.

In the future, when the smart contract implementation is stabilized, it may be considered to bring back the revised native module
implementation (if e.g. CosmWasm never intends to support triggering contracts by events rather than transactions and the on-chain automated collection is strongly desired).

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive
* Sandboxed environment
* Rust compiler and Rust-related verification tools could be utilized for higher assurance
* Implicit gas metering
* More light-weight and flexible approach to upgrades
* CW20 tokens could be used

### Negative
* Only manual payment collection: merchants or payment providers will need to set up their own cronjobs to submit transactions periodically
* Complexity on the wallet implementation: native tokens need to be explicitly moved to the subscription contract in advance and potentially wrapped as CW20
* Potentially higher storage requirements
* Complex audit trail: if one wants to fully verify the functionality, one will need to inspect Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm module, Wasmer interpreter, Rust compiler and Wasm optimizer, and CosmWasm smart contract

### Neutral
* Additional ecosystem tooling may need to be developed
* Execution speed may potentially slower than on the native module, but as the overall logic is likely going to be simpler, the overall performance may be better
